# SF Symbols Plugin Prototype

This repository is a prototype for implementing an SF Symbols package in Flutter.
The original issue can be found at [flutter/flutter#60034](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/60034) there is also a design doc at https://flutter.dev/go/sfsymbols

It's worth noting that I've never written any Objective-C before, so the platform code in here is a lot of guesswork and likely has some very basic mistakes. I'd really appreciate if someone could point them out to me either through issues or on the Flutter Discord (flogic#0001).
